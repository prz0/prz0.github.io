      You actually shouldn't be here. Instead, navigate to <a href="https://voxelprismatic.github.io/">/</a>, thanks!<br>

          Why redirect? Simple: I don't want to sync/rename github repos. That breaks things.<br>
          <sub>
             Also use Firefox, that way you don't have to ever see this screen ;]
